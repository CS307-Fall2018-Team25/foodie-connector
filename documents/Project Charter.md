## **Problem Statement** 

An increasingly large number of people choose food delivery over the past few years, yet people prefer to spend the same amount of money as they eat-in. Another problem is that the price of order usually does not satisfy the minimum delivery fee, which prevents people from choosing their preferred restaurant. Our website allows multiple users to order food from same restaurant online together to save money on the delivery fee and meet the minimum delivery charge amount. Additionally,we help users order food with their neighbor to lower the delivery fee and improve communication between each other.

## **Project Objectives**

1. Help friends to split delivery fees or total cost of the same order. 

1. Create user authentication system to protect their order and payment information.

1. Allow users order food with their neighbor to lower the delivery fee and improve communication between each other.
